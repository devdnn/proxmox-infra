# Project Infrastructure and Operations Configuration

This repository contains Terraform and Ansible configurations for managing the infrastructure and operational tools required for deploying and maintaining our applications. The structure is divided into infrastructure components (`infra`) for core services and operational components (`ops`) for monitoring, logging, and operational management.

### Infrastructure Components (`infra`)

- **Networking**: Includes VPC, subnets, and firewall rules.
- **Compute**: Configurations for virtual machines and container orchestration.
- **Storage**: Definitions for block storage, object storage, and database storage.
- **Load Balancers & DNS**: Load balancing and DNS management configurations.

### Operational Components (`ops`)

- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Setup for tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager.
- **Logging**: Centralized logging configurations, including ELK Stack or similar tools.
- **Security Tools**: Firewalls, intrusion detection, and vulnerability scanning setups.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Continuous integration and deployment configurations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) and [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html).
- Configure necessary credentials for your infrastructure provider.

### Deployment Instructions

1. **Initialize Terraform**:
   Navigate to the appropriate environment directory under `terraform/environments/` and run:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

2. **Apply Terraform Configuration**:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

3. **Run Ansible Playbooks**:
   After Terraform completes, use Ansible to configure the deployed resources:

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i ansible/inventory/<environment>/hosts.yml ansible/playbooks/<playbook>.yml
   ```

Replace `<environment>` and `<playbook>` with the appropriate environment folder and playbook name.
